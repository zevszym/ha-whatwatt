# WhatWatt Home Assistant Integration

Custom Home Assistant integration for WhatWatt Go devices that read data from electricity meters.

## Overview

This integration allows Home Assistant to receive and display data from WhatWatt Go devices via MQTT. It provides sensors for power consumption, power generation, energy usage, and voltage levels for all three phases.

4. Add the URL `https://github.com/vestiacom/whatwatt-home-asistance-integration` with category "Integration"
5. Click "Add"
6. Search for "WhatWatt" in the integrations tab
7. Click "Download"
8. Restart Home Assistant

### Option 2: Manual Installation Script

1. Clone this repository:

   cd whatwatt-home-asistance-integration
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh

### Option 3: Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/whatwatt` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory

## Configuration

1. Make sure your WhatWatt Go device is configured to send data to your MQTT broker
2. In Home Assistant, go to Settings > Devices & Services
3. Click "Add Integration" and search for "WhatWatt"
4. Enter the MQTT topic that your WhatWatt Go device is publishing to
5. Enter the IP address of your WhatWatt Go device (for accessing the configuration page)
6. Optionally, provide a custom name for the device

## Testing

A test script is included to simulate a WhatWatt device sending MQTT messages:

```bash
cd custom_components/whatwatt
pip install paho-mqtt
./test_mqtt_publish.py --broker localhost --port 1883 --topic whatwatt/test --interval 10
```
